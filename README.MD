# BASE TEMPLATING FRAMEWORKS

*Front:*

For the front end my goal is to have a common convention on all my frameworks that i use. There are what i try to duplicate everywhere

- Eslint
- Prettier
- Tailwind
- Tree and naming folders convention
- Typescript 

*Back:*

Back end is more what can i use for creating an API, and most of the time combined with docker for an all platform config

- Bun
- Symfony (api platform)
